movdata:genre_Action a mov:Genre;
  rdfs:label "Action";
  rdfs:comment "Should contain numerous scenes where action is spectacular and usually destructive. Often includes non-stop motion, high energy physical stunts, chases, battles, and destructive crises (floods, explosions, natural disasters, fires, etc.)";
  skos:note "If a movie contains just one action scene (even if prolonged, i.e. airplane-accident) it does not qualify.";
  skos:example "Die Hard (1988)", "The Avengers (2012) ", "Wonder Woman (2019)" .

movdata:genre_Adult a mov:Genre;
  rdfs:label "Adult";
  rdfs:comment "Reserved for explicit works of consenting hardcore sex or sexual activity, or strong fetish material involving adults, specifically those created for the purposes of titillation or arousal. Must be used with the plot keywords of 'hardcore' and 'sex' or 'special-sexual-interest'. Documentaries about this type of material do not use the Adult genre." .

movdata:genre_Adventure a mov:Genre;
  rdfs:label "Adventure";
  rdfs:comment "Should contain numerous consecutive and inter-related scenes of characters participating in hazardous or exciting experiences for a specific goal. Often include searches or expeditions for lost continents and exotic locales, characters embarking in treasure hunt or heroic journeys, travels, and quests for the unknown.

movdata:genre_Animation a mov:Genre;
  rdfs:label "Animation";
  rdfs:comment "Over 75% of the title's running time should have scenes that are wholly, or part-animated. Any form of animation is acceptable, e.g., hand-drawn, computer-generated, stop-motion, etc. Puppetry does not count as animation, unless a form of animation such as stop-motion is also applied. Incidental animated sequences should be indicated with the keywords part-animated or animated-sequence instead. Although the overwhelming majority of video games are a form of animation it's okay to forgo this genre when adding them as this is implied by the title type.";
  skos:example "Spirited Away (2001)", "The Lion King (1994)", "\"The Simpsons\" (1987)" .

movdata:genre_Biography a mov:Genre;
  rdfs:label "Biography";
  rdfs:comment "Primary focus is on the depiction of activities and personality of a real person or persons, for some or all of their lifetime. Events in their life may be reenacted, or described in a documentary style. If re-enacted, they should generally follow reasonably close to the factual record, within the limitations of dramatic necessity. A real person in a fictional setting would not qualify a production for this genre. If the focus is primarily on events, rather than a person, use History instead. ";
  skos:example "Judy (2019)", "Unbroken (2014)", "Erin Brockovich (2000)" .

movdata:genre_Comedy a mov:Genre;
  rdfs:label "Comedy";
  rdfs:comment "Virtually all scenes should contain characters participating in humorous or comedic experiences. The comedy can be exclusively for the viewer, at the expense of the characters in the title, or be shared with them. Please submit qualifying keywords to better describe the humor (i.e. spoof, parody, irony, slapstick, satire, dark-comedy, comedic-scene, etc.). If the title does not conform to the 'virtually all scenes' guideline then please do not add the comedy genre; instead, submit the same keyword variations described above to signify the comedic elements of the title. The subgenre keyword \"dramedy-drama\" can also be used to categorize titles with comedic undertones that qualify for the Drama genre but not necessarily the Comedy genre.";
  skos:example "Some Like it Hot (1959)", "When Harry Met Sally... (1989)", "Bridesmaids (2011)" .

movdata:genre_Documentary a mov:Genre;
  rdfs:label "Documentary";
  rdfs:comment """	Should contain numerous consecutive scenes of real personages and not characters portrayed by actors. This does not include fake or spoof documentaries, which should instead have the fake-documentary keyword. A documentary that includes actors re-creating events should include the keyword \"reenactment\" so that those actors are not treated as \"Himself.\" This genre should also be applied to all instances of stand-up comedy and concert performances""";

  rdfs:comment "Typically features dark, brooding characters, corruption, detectives, and the seedy side of the big city.

While some characters, incidents, and dialog may be fictional, these should be relatively minor points used primarily to bridge gaps in the record. Use of actual persons in an otherwise fictional setting, or of historic events as a backdrop for a fictional story, would not qualify. If the focus is primarily on one person's life and character, rather than events of historical scope, use Biography instead.";
